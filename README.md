# Rssly

A tool for serializing multiple RSS feeds into different formats.

Design-wise, this gem is responsible for:

- Encapsulating RSS Feed URL's
- Creating a collection of articles from either Feed URL's or persisted data
- Filtering that collection of articles
- Sorting that collection of articles
- Transforming the collection of articles into different formats

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rssly'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rssly
